### Purpose

This is the repostory created for use in conjunction with the course project of BUSADM 3632, section 4235. 

### Contents

Data Folder:
This folder contains 5 .csv files, each containing the sheet of the same name from the original workbook. These files are what we will use throughout our project. As such, they can be edited as necessary. The .csv format is used here in order to facilitate easy importing to the programs we intend to use (R, Tableau, etc.).

ORIGINAL_DATA_DO_NOT_TOUCH.xlsx:
This is the orginal workbook sent from Worthington Industries. As the file name suggests, this file should not be edited except under extreme circumstances. It's only purpose is to be a (hopefully unnecessary) backup.
